A Color Picker is an interactive tool used to select, customize, and manage colors in digital applications. It allows users to choose colors visually through color palettes, sliders, or color wheels instead of manually remembering color codes. This makes color selection easier, faster, and more accurate.

Color pickers support multiple color formats such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HEX (Hexadecimal), and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness). When a user selects a color, the tool instantly displays its code values, which can be directly used in web development, graphic design, or UI/UX projects. This ensures consistency in color usage across designs.

In web development, color pickers are commonly implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML <input type="color"> element provides a built-in color picker, while JavaScript enhances functionality by dynamically updating background colors, text colors, or showing real-time previews. Advanced color pickers may include opacity control, gradient selection, and color history.

Overall, a Color Picker improves user experience by simplifying color selection and reducing errors. It is widely used in applications such as image editors, website builders, design tools, and mobile apps.
